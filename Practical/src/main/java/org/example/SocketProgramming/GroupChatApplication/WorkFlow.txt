Steps:
    1. Sender will send request for connection to server with its username
    2. Server will check in hashmap if username already exists or not and then send necessary ack.
    3. Now sender will send message with recipient username and message to server
    4. Server will fetch socket associated with recipient username and using that socket it will send message.
